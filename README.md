# Unemployment and Adult Obesity in NC
This repository was created for Professor Gotzler's English 105 class in the Fall 2023 semester at UNC Chapel Hill.
### Contents
- This repository contains two `csv` files, found in the Data folder.
1. The [NC.UnemploymentAdultObesity_Data.csv](https://github.com/kayleechesnutt/unemployment-obesity-NC/blob/main/data/NC.UnemploymentAdultObesity_Data.csv) file contains the subset of data useful to analyze the Unemployment and Adult Obesity. It only contains data from North Carolina. It was created using the instructions found in the Python notebook. 
2. The [CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv](https://github.com/kayleechesnutt/unemployment-obesity-NC/blob/main/data/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv) file contains the raw data set.
- The repository also includes the [Python notebook](https://github.com/kayleechesnutt/unemployment-obesity-NC/blob/main/Python_Chesnutt3_1.ipynb) that documents the process for crafting the subset of data from the original data.

### What's Next?
After you have read this ReadMe page, you can go to the [Data](https://github.com/kayleechesnutt/unemployment-obesity-NC/tree/main/data) folder. This folder will give you access to the raw data set and the subset data. After you download the raw data set, feel free to go to Pyhton, and reproduce the dataframes. You can follow my step-by-step instructions to create a subset of the raw data set. The instructions are in the  [Python notebook](https://github.com/kayleechesnutt/unemployment-obesity-NC/blob/main/Python_Chesnutt3_1.ipynb).
